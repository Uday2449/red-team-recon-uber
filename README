**Author:** K. Uday Kiran  
**Date:** July 27, 2025  

## 📄 Project Overview
This project is a **simulated red-team reconnaissance** report on **Uber Technologies Inc**, created as part of an academic cybersecurity exercise.  
The objective was to demonstrate **passive and active reconnaissance techniques** used in the initial phase of a penetration test — without any unauthorized access or exploitation.

> ⚠ **Disclaimer:** This work is for **educational purposes only**. All reconnaissance was legal, safe, and conducted in a controlled/lab environment.  
> No systems were accessed or exploited.

## 🔍 Methodology

### **Passive Reconnaissance**
- WHOIS & DNS Enumeration
- Certificate Transparency Logs
- OSINT from LinkedIn, GitHub, Job Listings
- Tools: **Amass**, **Subfinder**, **Shodan**

### **Active Reconnaissance** *(Lab Environment Only)*
- Port scanning & OS fingerprinting with **Nmap**
- Service detection & version identification

---

## 📌 Key Findings
- Multiple exposed internal/staging subdomains
- Absence of DNSSEC records on primary domains
- Presence of wildcard subdomains increasing takeover risk
- Outdated lab DNS software (`dnsmasq 2.45`)
- Overexposed attack surface due to many public-facing assets

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Amass** – DNS enumeration & attack surface mapping  
- **Subfinder** – Fast subdomain discovery  
- **Shodan** – Public asset & service mapping  
- **Nmap** – Port scanning, OS & service detection
